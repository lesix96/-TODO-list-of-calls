# Calls ToDo Project (React, Redux)


This is  application for creating TODO list of calls, that is written in React/Redux (using Redux Form, moment.js, Ant Design, less). The environment is set up manually (Webpack). Application has phone number validation using RegEx. Table of Calls is sortable by Name and Time. It has also a button "Next", that calls a Modal, that can show user next call (compared to the present time). All data stores in localStorage.

How to set up my app:
1) npm install
2) npm run start
